# 🖥️ My Home Lab

Welcome to my Home Lab repository! This is where I experiment, learn, and build projects related to data analytics, cloud computing, and system administration. My home lab is a personal environment designed to simulate real-world workflows and scenarios, enabling me to deepen my understanding of various technologies and tools.

## 🚀 Overview

In my Home Lab, I host a variety of tools and platforms to practice end-to-end data workflows, cloud infrastructure management, and more. Below is an overview of what I’ve set up and what I’m currently exploring:

### 🔍 Data Analytics Workflows
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Data Processing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **ETL**: Custom ETL pipelines built using Python
- **Data Visualization**: Grafana, Matplotlib
- **Reporting**: SQL-based reports and Excel dashboards

### ☁️ Virtualization and Containerization
- **Virtualization**: Proxmox VE for managing virtual machines
- **Containers**: Docker for containerized applications

### 🛡️ Security and Networking
- **Firewalls**: pfSense for network security
- **SSL/TLS**: Certbot and Let’s Encrypt for HTTPS
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana for system and application monitoring

### 🛠️ System Administration
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu, Debian
- **Automation**: Bash and PowerShell scripting
- **Storage**: Network Attached Storage (NAS) setup with OpenMediaVault & Nextcloud

## 📚 Learning and Experimentation

This lab is a continuous work in progress. Here’s what I’m currently focused on:
- **Data Integration**: Exploring ways to connect different data sources and streamlining data flows.
- **Advanced SQL**: Enhancing my SQL skills by working with complex queries, stored procedures, and performance tuning.
- **Cloud-Native Applications**: Deploying and managing cloud-native applications in a simulated cloud environment.
- **Data Security**: Implementing and testing security measures to protect data and ensure privacy.

## 🧠 Why a Home Lab?

My Home Lab is a sandbox environment where I can break things, fix them, and learn from the process. It allows me to:
- Practice and refine my technical skills.
- Explore new tools and technologies.
- Understand the intricacies of data workflows and cloud management.
- Prepare for real-world scenarios in a risk-free setting.
